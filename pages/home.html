      <h2>Edexcel Programs</h2>
      <p>The Pearson Edexcel Curriculum for International Schools
        The comprehensive Pearson Edexcel curriculum is based on the UK Key Stages and supports students from Reception all the way through Advanced Levels and university preparation.  Each step of the way builds on the skills and knowledge acquired in the previous stage and delivers a bridge to the next level.
        <br><br>
        The Pearson Edexcel iPrimary Curriculum The first step, PearsonEdexcel iPrimary, is designed especially for English Language Learners (ELL) who are studying the majority of their curriculum subjects in English. Beginning with Reception and continuing through Year 6, iPrimary takes the best approaches of a first language curriculum and combines them with ELL progression and support, ensuring that students will be well prepared for the second step - iLowerSecondary. 
        <br><br>
        The Pearson Edexcel iLowerSecondary Curriculum
        The second step, Pearson Edexcel iLowerSecondary, provides seamless progression from iPrimary to the International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) in Years 7 through 9 by continuing to support English Language Learners (ELL) in order to access the full range of subjects taught in English.
        <br><br>
        The Pearson Edexcel International General Certificate of Secondary Education
        The International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) is perhaps the best known UK qualification as it provides the means to enter many competitive colleges and universities.  It is also the best preparation for studying Advanced Level subjects.  IGCSE tuition begins in Year 10 with externally moderated exams in Year 11.  Edexcel International GCSEs are studied in over 55 countries worldwide and at over 350 independent schools in the UK. Available in more than 40 subjects, they are equivalent, grade for grade, to UK GCSEs.
        <br><br>
        Pearson Edexcel International Advanced Levels
        Edexcel International Advanced Levels have been written to the highest standard, with the global learner in mind, and are recognised by universities across the world.  Available in 19 popular subjects, they offer progression from International GCSEs and can be taken together with BTEC subjects for a wide selection of specialised study in preparation for university and career success.

      <h2>Benefits of "A" level</h2>
      <p>1. A Levels are the most valued qualifications for entry into UK universities
        If you plan to attend university in the UK, then you should consider taking A levels first. UK universities do accept other entrance qualifications, however A levels are given greater consideration. With A levels you do not have to take foundation courses - you can begin work on your degree immediately. They are also internationally recognised without additional verification.
        <br><br>
        2. They are the best preparation for university courses
        The very best way to prepare for UK university courses is by taking A levels. A level courses are essentially university entrance exams, and the study skills required for success in A levels are the same study skills needed to succeed at university.
        <br><br>
        3. Top universities prefer A levels
        The best way to get into a top university is by having an excellent academic record which includes A level qualifications. The most competitive universities prefer students with excellent marks in A level subjects.
        <br><br>
        4. They allow you to specialize in subjects of your choice
        A levels are designed to allow you to focus on the subjects which will be most directly connected with your course of study at university. The subjects most frequently chosen by international students are Business, Mathematics and Sciences as well as core Humanities subjects, including English and History.
        <br><br>
        6. They develop the English skills you need at university
        All A level classes help international students develop exceptional English language skills, which are a huge advantage when starting university.
        <br><br>
        7. Even employers prefer A levels
        It’s not only universities which prefer candidates with A levels. Employers are also becoming increasingly interested in candidates whose A level results indicate early talents in key subjects.
        With all of these benefits, it’s no surprise that the popularity of A levels with international students is on the rise.

      <h2>Student Support</h2>
      <p>Learning Support

        Learning Support provides additional help to students in lessons and throughout the academic year. Our aim is to identify individual student needs, to deliver differentiated and specifically designed programme to help them achieve better results.
        
        Learning support can be given in many ways:
        <br><br>
        <span>&#8226;</span>in-class support<br><br>
        <span>&#8226;</span>after-class support<br><br>
        <span>&#8226;</span>small group consulting hours<br><br>
        <span>&#8226;</span>individual consulting hours<br><br>
        <span>&#8226;</span>English Language Support (ELS)<br><br>
        
            <br><br>
        
        Learning Support works on Individual Educational Plans which are designed to help students to overcome learning barriers.
        
        <br><br>
         
        Counselling
        
        In our school, we support our students in all ways. As the Oxbridge Academy team, we offer our qualified counselor who confidentially supports our students through one-to-one counselling. Moreover, our staff is also trained to support students not only in school but also outside.
        
        Our aim is to help students to be individuals, and help them to work through their difficulties, understand themselves better and find the ways of managing their situation, offering them consultations with our counselor.
        
        Psychological tests of the students are done with the aim of identifying the level of their cognitive development. Annual surveys are also done for the students to determine the dynamics of cognitive processes in them. The students are monitored during the classes and breaks. Additionally, there are consultation hours for the students, parents and members of the staff (teachers). Additional surveys are commissioned by the administration during the year. Staff members and students have some thematic courses and with that they also need to pass trainings and attend the seminars. The teachers, as all the staff members, need to pass psych diagnostic tests before being hired to work. Conducting psychological games, quizzes and contents for the students is also offered.
        
        In addition, Counselling is not about giving advice or opinions, nor is it a friendly chat with a friend. The counsellor helps the students to understand themselves better and find their own solutions to resolve or cope with their situation.
        
        <br><br>
         
        Health Support
        
        Our doctor works full time at Oxbridge Academy. Her office is located on the first floor, on the left side of the corridor. It is open from 8:30 am to 4:30 pm.
        
        If a student feels sick during the school day, the homeroom teacher sends him/her to the doctor’s office where the doctor checks and decides to, either, return him/her to class, or send them home. Afterwards, the doctor informs the homeroom teacher if she is sending the student home, and the homeroom teacher informs the parents and the administration about the situation.
